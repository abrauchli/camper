# LED Lighting on Deck & Ramp

- Time: 1 day
- Money: $150 _TODO: check receipts_

## Project Goal

Indirect decorating lighting on the deck

## Implementation

- Cold 110V AC LED strips (12V or colored LED strips would also work) Since the
  whole strip draws about 150W I decided to go with the 110V because of the
  voltage drop on 12V.
- Soldered and waterproofed junction
- Routed along railings and hinges

## Notes

- Way too bright at 100%, use dimmer and check if you prefer warm-white (I did
  natural daylight/cold light)
- 110V keeps the wires thin with such long strips
- Push-connect seems flaky. Make sure the strips are tested prior to
  water-proofing with silicone glue and shrink tubing.
- The 6" loops on the hinges work well when folding the railing and are not in
  the way when stored for transport.
- Spray painting the white connectors with black enamel worked well and makes
  them harder to distinguish from the railing.
