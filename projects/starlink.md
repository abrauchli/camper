## Notes / Lessons
- Just because the Amazon product says IP68, doesn't mean it is.
- Use Lag screws provided with the Starlink Mobility Mount to fasten to the
  roof
- Dicor sealant (Non-sag or self-leveling) around fasteners
- Junction box on roof allows for replacement of the roof cable without having
  to pull the cabling through the camper
- Leave drip loops on both roof and interior runs
