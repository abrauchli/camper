# Dining Table

- Time: 1-2 days, over multiple days. Mostly coating the table.
- Money: $400

A sturdy dining table for a family of six that can also be used for homeschool
activities.

Built together with the [Storage L-bench](storage-dining-bench.md) and lower
legs, it could also double as a bed, but we haven't used it as such nor do we
plan on.

## Materials

- [Acacia Butcher Block](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-6-ft-L-x-25-in-D-Unfinished-Acacia-Butcher-Block-Countertop-with-Standard-Edge-TP-AC-002/319958691)
  (that's the one pictured in the Grand Design Momentum 395m) or
  [Birch Butcher Block](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-6-ft-L-x-25-in-D-Unfinished-Birch-Solid-Wood-Butcher-Block-Countertop-with-Square-Edge-1003076452/319218748)
  (used in a previous trailer) from Home Depot (treated with oil based
  Polyurethane, pic below - alternative
  [Mineral Oil Conditioner](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-16-oz-Clear-Hardwax-Mineral-Butcher-Block-Oil-Conditioner-1000053495/319435029))
  said to be more food safe. We tried this on a previous camper and like the
  Polyurethane much better because it's harder. Mineral oil needs to be
  reapplied periodically.
- [1 Qt Oil based Polyurethane](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Varathane-1-qt-Clear-Gloss-Oil-Based-Interior-Polyurethane-341719/305583790)
- [Polyurethane Brush 12Pcs](https://www.amazon.com/Bates-Brushes-Painting-Staining-Sponges/dp/B0CSXDSMLY?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  One brush per application layer. Need about 10.

- [Legs](https://www.amazon.com/Class-Customs-Black-Surface-Plastic/dp/B08562XH7G?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Two-pack, you'll need two. We only use 3 legs for more legroom in the
  "L-corner" of the bench. We initially tried two legs but that was too wobbly
  sideways.
- [Stools](https://www.amazon.com/IBUYKE-Cushion-Upholstered-Entryway-WBD007NG/dp/B0DBHD6DMT?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We store three of those under the table.

## Dimensions

- 58x25"
- Table top sits at 30" from floor.

## Notes

- [Orbital sander](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-Random-Variable-DWE6423-Renewed/dp/B09YVXVNCX?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  (renewed, great value)
- [60, 80 and 240 grit Sandpaper](https://www.amazon.com/WORKPRO-150-piece-Sandpaper-Set-Different/dp/B07HHY6MKY?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  This is a whole set that will last a bunch of projects Use 60 if your block
  surface is not even, 80 otherwise to round the edges. Then a fine grit in
  between dried coats of Polyurethane.
- When coating, start with the bottom of the table to get a feel for the amount
  of Polyurethane needed. When dry, flip and do the top and edges. Repeat 5-8
  times until the table is saturated.
- For mounting the table, assemble the legs and position the table with the help
  of someone else. Try to sit down at the table and check for enough knee-space
  to determine where the legs should go. Then mount them to the table.
- With the legs mounted to the table, position the table again and mount to the
  floor. Check how thick your slide-out OSB panel is and dimension your screws
  accordingly ensuring you don't go through the bottom. Retract the slide-out to
  measure the floor thickness as the front-side of the floor-board is typically
  thinner.
