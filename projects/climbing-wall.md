## Goal

Replace ladder with a permanent setup that's fun for kids to use and usable for
adults while still allowing the ladder as a backup.

## Dimensions

- 2ft wide climbing wall, as high as desired (I kept it inside the trim)
- 2x2' washer-cover board

## Materials

- 3/4" Plywood Board
- [3/8-16 T-Nuts (50Pcs)](https://www.amazon.com/Wensilon-50pcs-8-16-T-nut-Four-jaw/dp/B0D6QRKBDS?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  16$

  This product seems to be similar to what we have, but **we have **not** tested
  this product.** Double-check screw length with desired board.\*\*

  We had another one before this one with natural fibres but it got hairy and
  started breaking under load. This one seems sturdier and doesn't shed.

## Notes

- Measure out the washer cutout at the bottom of the wall
- Firmly attach plywood board to studs
- Sand down plywood board and edges with 80, then 240 grit
- Treat the plywood board at least for standing surfaces (over the washer)
- Use angle brackets and screws to hold the plywood boards around the washer
  together
- Install and test the washer first (rear access is hard after)
- The mesh net and the eye screws comfortably hold an adult
- Those blue U-shaped plastic handles that form a ladder are OK for small
  children (40lbs) but **will definitely not support adults**. The hole spacing
  only matched one stud on the climbing wall side, so I had to add a second
  screw into a stud on the side facing away from the climbing wall.
- One blue plastic handle did support a 155lbs adult when mounted vertically
  (next to loft entrance.) but don't make them a safety-essential element since
  I doubt there's a spec'ed weight on them.
- We haven't used the ladder since. It just lays on the floor at the side.
