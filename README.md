## Couch

* Linsy Home Storage Couch. We have and love the [Rubik I](
  https://www.amazon.com/LINSY-HOME-Sectional-Sectionals-Reamovable/dp/B0DSWN15J4?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  model but it's phased out. Ours has single-seat dimensions of 20.1"D x 25.6"W
  x 34.4"H which has since changed in the available [Rubik III](
  https://www.amazon.com/LINSY-HOME-Sectional-Removable-Convertible/dp/B0D97CJ7TZ?tag=rvlifehacks-20) so check your measurements.
* 2 Pack 2.5" square corner utility hinges from Walmart (two hinges per seat, comes with screws)

## Dishwasher

Works fine on 13 amp connection, technically needs 16 amps as per manual.

* [Dishwasher](https://www.amazon.com/FOTILE-Dishwasher-Combination-Energy-saving-SD2F-P3/dp/B0BZGXYQ4S?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* Plumbing supplies (ABS pipes, elbows and primer) from Home Depot

## Kitchen

* [Magnetic Knife Holder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQQM6GW?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Works great. Never lost a knife in transit either.
* [Hanging Basket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKF9MDFZ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Great for storing fruit. Hangs on the side of a cabinet.
* [Napkin holder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYJGXTCM?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Has a little weight on top that keep the napkins from flying away.

## Bathroom

* [Shower](https://www.amazon.com/MENATT-Stainless-Adjustable-Rainfall-Handheld/dp/B0CRDGC83N?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Very happy with this one. Needs some clear silicone around the edges but if
  you're not doing other silicone jobs, just get a little tube instead of the
  gun.
* [Cabinet Fences](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Stainless-Bathroom-Organization-Accessories/dp/B0C2Z532X9?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We use those in the bathroom cabinet, not the shower.
* [Shower Corners](https://www.amazon.com/Sakugi-Corner-Shower-Caddy-Space-Saving/dp/B0CMJ8H7ZD?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We use those for the shower corners.
* [Toothbrush Holder](https://www.amazon.com/Oasiteege-Toothbrush-Toothpaste-Organizer-Accessories/dp/B0CTG5JW7G?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We use two of those for the kids' toothbrushes and toothpaste.
* [Vent Fan Motor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPXHTH54?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Drop-in 12V replacement for the original.
* [Vent Cover](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HCNJDPK?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Washer

* [Washer](https://www.amazon.com/Splendide-WDV2200XCD-Combo-Washer-Vented/dp/B004RCYNVO?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Washes well and is great on water use. Comparing with others, it seems this one uses only about half.
* [Dicor Lap Sealant](https://www.amazon.com/Dicor-651SANSW-1-Non-Leveling-Ultra-Sealant/dp/B0949J5PQZ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Use non-sag sealant on the screw holes and the vent cover if you drill the hole yourself.

## Boat Teak Deck

* [Primer](https://www.amazon.com/3M-3M23929-94-Primer-Quarts/dp/B07L8KMHVX?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Floor mat](https://www.amazon.com/OCEANBROAD-Self-Adhesive-Flooring-Non-Slip-MotorBoats/dp/B0BR9WQ9ML?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* 4-6" Roller from Home Depot

## Table

* Butcher Block from Home Depot
* [Legs](https://www.amazon.com/Class-Customs-Black-Surface-Plastic/dp/B08562XH7G?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Hinges](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Continuous-Thickness-Knuckle-Included/dp/B0BR155SHQ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Starlink

* Starlink Residential 3rd Gen Standard Dish
* Starlink Standard Mobility Mount is best for a permanent spot on the RV roof.
  Then use the kickstand that's included with the standard dish when you're parked right under a tree.
* [Dicor Lap Sealant](https://www.amazon.com/Dicor-651SANSW-1-Non-Leveling-Ultra-Sealant/dp/B0949J5PQZ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  To seal the roof after mounting the mobility mount with the lag screws (ideally into the roof trusses.)
  You can use both self-leveling of non-sag. This is the non-sag which is a bit
  stickier and also works for small repairs on the side of the roof or for
  sealing a vent cover for the washer in the side of the RV.
* Optionally, the X-frame base might make it a bit easier than the kickstand to
* get optimal orientation.
  We never had need for this though.
* [Outdoor RJ45 cable CAT6 or more](https://www.amazon.com/Ethernet-Unshielded-Waterproof-Resistant-Internet/dp/B0B14CRJL1?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Waterproof Junction Box](https://www.amazon.com/Dustproof-Waterproof-Universal-Electrical-125x86x62mm/dp/B077QM9VM9?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Starlink subscription referral](https://starlink.com/residential?referral=RC-3762258-55110-60&app_source=share)
  A free month of Starlink. We wanted to go with cellular and Starlink only
  when out of cell range but we blew through the 50G in three days, so now we
  always use the Unlimited. Not cheap but definitely worth it. Read my
  [Starlink Review](https://bitcreed.us/bitblog/starlink-on-the-road).

## Bike Rack

Works well for 4-6 bikes (2 wedged in between). Also fits all bikes in the RAM 3500 long bed.
* [4-bike rack](https://www.amazon.com/Bike-Rack-Safeguard-Derailleurs-Waterproof/dp/B0F4X41X8C?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Bed

* [30" gas struts 150lbs](https://www.amazon.com/Springs-Support-Storage-Toolbox-IAQWE/dp/B0CQSM7WV7?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Get less than 150lbs for lighter mattress and/or without latex topper
* [Latex topper](https://www.amazon.com/Latex-Mattress-Topper-GOLS-Organic/dp/B09Z7SJGTD?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Works well but leaves a permanent print with 150lbs person. That shouldn't be

### Kids Beds
* [Mattress (cut to size)](https://www.amazon.com/Greaton-4-Inch-High-Density-Replacement-Application/dp/B0BXYFHCNY?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Breathable Mattress Underlay](https://www.amazon.com/Mattress-Breathable-Meshfiber-Ventilation-Aire-Flow/dp/B0DJS3HHQ3?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Mouse Traps

* [Zapper traps](https://www.amazon.com/OWLTRA-OW-2-Electric-Instant-Trigger/dp/B099X9F9CD?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Water

* [Quick connects](https://www.amazon.com/Eden-95210-Premium-Fitting-Connect/dp/B08H4DJ7VF?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Block water flow when unplugged with water turned on.

## Curtains and Shades

* [Curtain Rods](https://www.amazon.com/Byondeth-Curtain-Adjustable-Diameter-Aluminium/dp/B0B7WQVYGF?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Apply locktite to the screws retaining the rods since they tend to vibrate loose.
* [Magnetic Curtain binders](https://www.amazon.com/KLOGTSIND-Magnetic-Tiebacks-Wood-Farmhouse/dp/B0CHRTZKB6?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Actual curtains (cloth)](https://www.amazon.com/HPD-Half-Price-Drapes-PRCT-D214A-84/dp/B09MMBRLD3?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Shades](https://www.amazon.com/Persilux-Cordless-Free-Stop-Insulated-Protection/dp/B0DJGF6LL3?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Furrion Vision S Backup Cam

* [8dBi antenna](https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Pigtail-Wireless-Routers-Repeater/dp/B07PBFKJSN?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We got this one and it works better than the stock antenna, but it would be
  better if the paddle was rotated by 90deg. I use it angled down rather than
  like a shark fin.
  
## Griddle

* [Replacement Screws for Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Petrirufun-Screws-Blackstone-Stand-Replacement/dp/B0BZ3FJPTY?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Wind Guards](https://www.amazon.com/Blackstone-Accessories-MeWeBlue-5018-Compatible/dp/B0BLNDX7L3?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Gas hose with Quick-Connect](https://www.amazon.com/GASPRO-Propane-Connect-Extension-Pressure/dp/B09XF1M1RG?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Gas Y Connector](https://www.amazon.com/Propane-Motorhome-Tabletop-Splitter-Disconnect/dp/B0F5ZZS18H?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Scraper](https://www.amazon.com/Blackstone-Accessories-Barbecue-Stainless-Cleaning/dp/B0DP8TP4WH?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Cover](https://www.amazon.com/Cover-Blackstone-22-Grill-Water-Resistant/dp/B09V72F8XQ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Burger Press](https://www.amazon.com/SHINESTAR-Blackstone-Griddle-Pre-Seasoned-Outdoor/dp/B0CL6PRSGN?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Generator

Onan 5500 Evap

* [Fuel Filter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RCT19I?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Oil Filter and Wrench Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNCK6J53?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Oil](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAP43W?tag=rvlifehacks-20)

## Fridge

* [Vent for Outside](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6T1LLMX?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Great addon, works really well, but when power cuts it needs to be put in
  manual mode by hand or it won't run.
* [RV Fridge Outside Cover Clips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP6NX5DY?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Quite stiff, probably not as good as the original but those weren't really good either.. so far those worked.


## Plumbing and Sewage

* [Valve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RRTZKF?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Every time you fix a line that doesn't have a stop valve on the manifold, do yourself a favor and add one.
* [Sewer Hose Support](https://www.amazon.com/Beech-Lane-Support-Collapse-Drainage/dp/B0BQ7J77PC?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Note the little arch at the bottom that is useful for crossing with the power or water line.
* [Backflush Valve](https://www.amazon.com/Camco-Blaster-Rinser-Backflow-39086/dp/B072VSRG8T?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Regularly backflush your tanks to keep their volume and functionality.
* [10' Sewer Hose](https://www.amazon.com/Camco-39639-Revolution-Extension-Pre-Attached/dp/B074JFRW3L?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We keep three of those and a shorter one (included with the tote tank below).
* [28 Ga Tote Tank](https://www.amazon.com/Camco-Rhino-28-Gallon-Tote-Built/dp/B07K87FR5C?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Great for sites without sewage. Hookable to a rear ladder. We attached ours to
  the roof with spare unistruts from the solar install.

## Chocks and Leveling

* [Wheel chocks (pack of two)](https://www.amazon.com/Camco-Wheel-Chock-Removal-Trailer/dp/B071KY2K37?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Small enough to conveniently store away, big enough to be useful on slopes or the truck.
  The ones with ropes are nice to carry, but the 7$ price difference is
  definitely not justified. [Standard chocks](
  https://www.amazon.com/Camco-Wheel-Chock-Removal-Trailer/dp/B00K1C1WC2).

### Andersen Equipment

* [Andersen Jack Blocks](https://www.amazon.com/ANDERSEN-Accessories-Stabilizers-Jackstands-Quickjack/dp/B0888SDR63?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  MUST-HAVE TWO 8" ones! Our Momentum has slightly outward-facing leveling
  jacks which is the worst idea ever because since it forms a triangle, as you
  push up the rig tension applies to the I-Beams and/or the jack pads start
  sliding. To minimize the sliding, you need blocks as high as possible.
  Andersen are a solid choice because of the little side-wall that prevents
  sliding. The magnets are nice but will stop working well if your metal jack
  pad is bent.  Lifetime warranty story: One of our blocks that we had gotten
  used with the camper was replaced free of charge (except shipping ~15$) by
  Andersen when it cracked. While it lost about 2" in height, it still retained
  the camper!  Fantastic customer service.
* [Set of 4x 8", 2x 4"](https://www.amazon.com/ANDERSEN-Accessories-Stabilizers-Jackstands-Quickjack/dp/B0F11L567T?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We wouldn't recommend all big ones because there's plenty of situations where
  the trailer is too slanted to fit the 8" under the rear jacks, but the 4"
  would fit. If storage is an issue, get only two 8" ones and do the rest with
  leveling blocks. If storage is not an issue, this seems like the ideal set.

* [Andersend Fifhwheel Hitch](https://www.amazon.com/ANDERSEN-Connection-Gooseneck-Accessories-3220/dp/B09H7SMYZ5?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Was recommended to us by a fulltimer-friend. Absolutely happy with it because
  it allows for two additional 28Ga storage totes behind the hitch (in a long bed).
  The hitch mounts to the gooseneck ball in the truck bed.
  Make sure to chock your trailer properly when hitching and unhitching because
  you have to push the front over the hitch, so it'll be inclined much steeper
  than with the regular hitch.

* [Safety Chains](https://www.amazon.com/MEPARERI-Ultimate-Connection-Trailer-Safety/dp/B0CN6XB9QP?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Much better value than the [Andersen original](
  https://www.amazon.com/3249-Ultimate-Connection-Safety-Chains/dp/B0792C5XRW?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  . The knock-off has fully satisfied us and also comes with the hooks for the
  Andersen hitch adapter.
  Some states may require chains when not using a standard fifthwheel hitch.
  Even if not, they've come in handy for other purposes: I hook my
  roll-and-lock tonneau cover int it and it works on tow hooks for people stuck
  on the beach.

## Screen Doors
* [Screen Defender for 28" Door](https://www.amazon.com/Lippert-Components-859793-Defender-Protector/dp/B086HHKQVW?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Screen Defender for 30" Door](https://www.amazon.com/Lippert-Components-859794-Defender-Protector/dp/B086HJRRRS?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  One for the front and one for the back door. Great with little kids. Also works for dogs and cats that don't jump above the door handle.
* [Screen Repair Tape](https://www.amazon.com/Grey-30-FT-Adhesive-Fiberglass/dp/B0BYZ7XBSG?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Not as pretty as replacing the whole screen but it works really well and doesn't look too bad.
* [Screen Repair Kit](https://www.amazon.com/HOMMEE-Screen-Repair-Kit-Installing/dp/B0B1B3VTMJ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Great tool to push the spline back in when it gets loose.

## Random Stuff
* [Tripod Stabilizer](https://www.amazon.com/Schumaho-Gooseneck-Stabilizer-Adjustable-%EF%BC%88Patented/dp/B0DRGVGBD1?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Works with the Andersen hitch. For a regular fifth-wheel hitch, use the [King Pin variation](https://www.amazon.com/Schumaho-Gooseneck-Stabilizer-Adjustable-%EF%BC%88Patented/dp/B0CL56P9KF?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Must-have item for everyone with washer/drying in their front. Nice to have
  for everyone else. Measure your height and make sure it's enough. We need
  some leveling blocks in some cases to keep it straight or extend it to the
  necessary height.
* [Climbing net](https://www.amazon.com/Bunifa-Climbing-Playground-Stairway-Polyester/dp/B0CJJJ321V?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Door stoppers](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Co-op-DE1586-Nautical-White/dp/B00AU4D9H2?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Bluetooth Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Stage-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0CHKTDXWP?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Has a battery, aux input and also works over just USB-C to the computer.
* [Slim dresser](https://www.amazon.com/Sorbus-Kids-Dresser-Drawers-Organizer/dp/B0DYPZV8TJ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Pickup cargo net](https://www.amazon.com/TireTek-Accessories-Heavy-Duty-Stretches-Carabiners/dp/B07ZQP5QG7?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Outdoor rug](https://www.amazon.com/HEBE-Outdoor-Waterproof-Reversible-Backyard/dp/B0CKVCWYFX?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Rug works fine, USB broke off after less than a handful of uses.
* [RV Propane Regulator](https://www.amazon.com/Fairview-GR-9984-Automatic-Changeover-Regulator/dp/B0CJL6M1S4?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Drain Valve Lubricant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BGK2L0?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Only use on black tanks and if valve gets sticky. Don't use as preventive measure. This one is water-soluble and doesn't contain silicones.
* [Awning Motor Idler Cover](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWZLLFC6?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Lost one on the road. This one replaces it. Needs both halves replaced even if you still have one as it doesn't have the same curving.
* [Magnetic Work Lights](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYSXSDKT?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Doubles as bicycle light if you're willing to hold it while riding.
* [Laundry Basket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG1VNT9M?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Works fine in the kids bathroom.
