## RV Towing

* [2" Hitch Adapter Reducer Sleeve](https://www.amazon.com/Curt-Manufacturing-45405-Reducer-Sleeve/dp/B001EOWQRQ?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Reduces the 2.5" Hitch adapter to a regular 2" so you can use the cheaper ball-hitch for the dump tote or lighter trailers.
* [Lockable Hitch Pin](https://www.amazon.com/CZC-AUTO-Receiver-Stainless-Trailer/dp/B081644R21?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
* [Pickup cargo net](https://www.amazon.com/TireTek-Accessories-Heavy-Duty-Stretches-Carabiners/dp/B07ZQP5QG7?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  You'll want it after loosing random stuff on the freeway. Works well with the Andersen hitch in the middle.

## Maintenance

* [Diesel Supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Stanadyne-Diesel-Performance-Formula-38566/dp/B000M5QPSY?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Cetane Booster. Keeps the engine and injectors clean. We use it on every tank fill.
* [Tire Pressure Gauge](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BY2GD9VC?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Very precise and consistent. Much better than the mechanical Walmart ones. Goes up to enough pressure (90psi works fine)
* [On-the-go Compressor](https://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Heavy-Duty-Compressor-Portable-1-97CFM/dp/B0CJFCRKBD?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Best little compressor I ever had. Been using it for over a year almost
  daily. Works great for the 90psi on the trailer. With the crocodile clamps it
  can draw more power than with the cigarette adapter but you will need to pop
  the hood or use the trailer batteries.
  I have the manual gauge but I linked the digital one because it has the
  auto-shut-off which I wish I'd have. While the cable and hose are very long,
  I use a jumper cable set as extension to reach the third wheel on the
  trailer.
* [Quick-Connect Valve Adapters](https://www.amazon.com/Locking-Inflator-Adapter-Connection-Compressor/dp/B0C15BSDF7?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Push-on instead of screwing on.
* [OEM Mopar Oil Filter](https://www.amazon.com/Mopar-05083285AA-Engine-Oil-Filter/dp/B0046NNNGK?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  We always get the OEM one since it's good value.
* [3Ga Engine Oil 15W40](https://www.amazon.com/Rotella-550050467-3PK-Synthetic-15W-40-1-Gallon/dp/B07PSVLF6G?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Exactly what you need for one oil change. Works well for towing across the US
  temperature zones. Get something more viscous if you plan on staying longer
  in very cold areas. For just the occasional cold start, the 15W40 still works great.
* [Funnel](https://www.amazon.com/Hopkins-10704-FloTool-Spill-Measu-Funnel/dp/B0799NJSTP?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  The closing-function is perfect for dosing. Sits well in the transmission fluid dipstick tube.
* [Fuel Filter Set](https://www.amazon.com/Separator-2013-2018-Replaces-68197867AA-68157291AA/dp/B07KS7SYG1?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Not the OEM but works great. Good value. Already bought this twice.
* [AISIN AS69RC Transmission Fluid](https://www.amazon.com/Mobil-55221-Automatic-Transmission-Fluid/dp/B00BLKXW9O?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  Rarely needed. But unlike others, this one ships to Amazon counters.
  Although I would have gotten the Mopar ASRC if I had gotten my hands on it,
  I'm very happy with this one. I used 10.5 Quarts with the filter change.
  This has 12 Qts.
* [AISIN AS69RC Transmission Oil Filter](https://www.amazon.com/Cireworx-C101-K-Transmission-68224232AA-6821491AA/dp/B0D51LKVST?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  I would have used the OEM if it was available but I'm happy with this one.
  Comes with the gasket included, although mine was in good enough shape to be
  reused.

## Tuning

* [Monster RAM Intake Elbow](https://www.amazon.com/Banks-MONSTER-Compatible-Replacement-INTAKE-42798-PC/dp/B09ZCPKJ27?tag=rvlifehacks-20)
  I'm not interested in more performance, just didn't want the "Grid heater bolt" issue. Was a fun job to install and has been working great.
